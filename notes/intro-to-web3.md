### 🔹 What is Web3?
Web3 is the next version of the internet — built on **blockchains**.  
It focuses on **decentralization**, **ownership**, and **transparency**.

### 🪙 Key Components
- **Blockchain:** A shared public database  
- **Smart Contracts:** Self-executing code on the blockchain  
- **Tokens:** Digital assets that represent ownership/value  
- **dApps:** Decentralized applications that run on-chain
